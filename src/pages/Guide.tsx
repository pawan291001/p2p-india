    content: [
      "Crypto P2P is a fully decentralised peer-to-peer trading platform built on BNB Smart Chain. It allows users to buy and sell USDT and BNB directly with each other using Indian Rupees (INR) — without any middlemen, centralised exchanges, or KYC requirements.",
      "Every trade is secured by an on-chain escrow smart contract. The seller's tokens are locked in the contract the moment they create an ad. This means buyers can trade with confidence — the crypto is already held safely before any money changes hands.",
      "There are zero platform fees. The only cost is the tiny BNB gas fee for on-chain transactions, which is usually under ₹1.",
    ],
  },

    title: "Step 1 — Connect Your Wallet",
    content: [
      "To start trading, you need a crypto wallet that supports BNB Smart Chain. Popular options include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.",
      "Click the \"Connect Wallet\" button in the top-right corner of the navbar. A popup will appear showing supported wallets. Select yours, approve the connection, and make sure you're on the BNB Smart Chain network.",

    title: "Step 2 — Browse Sell Ads",
    content: [
      "The main P2P Trading page shows all active sell ads from other users. Each ad card displays the seller's wallet address, the token they're selling (USDT or BNB), the price per token in INR, and their preferred payment method.",
      "You can filter ads by cryptocurrency (USDT or BNB) using the filter buttons at the top. Ads are sorted by price so you can quickly find the best deals.",
      "Each ad also shows the total amount available and the deal timeout — how long you'll have to complete the payment after accepting.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "escrow",
    title: "Step 3 — How Escrow Works",
    content: [
      "When a seller creates an ad, their tokens are immediately transferred from their wallet into the escrow smart contract. This is an on-chain transaction that locks the tokens — the seller cannot withdraw them once the ad is live.",
      "When a buyer accepts a deal, the tokens remain locked. The buyer then sends INR payment directly to the seller through the chosen payment method (UPI, Bank Transfer, etc.).",
      "After the buyer confirms they've sent the payment, the seller checks their bank/UPI and confirms receipt on the platform. The smart contract then automatically releases the tokens to the buyer's wallet.",
      "This flow ensures neither party can scam the other — the seller can't run away with both crypto and INR, and the buyer's payment is tracked through the deal timeline.",

      "Send the exact INR amount shown in the deal to the seller's provided payment details. Double-check the amount and account details before sending.",
      "After sending payment, click \"I Have Paid\" to notify the seller. The deal timer is ticking, so complete your payment promptly.",
      "The seller will then check their account for the incoming payment. Once they confirm receipt, the smart contract releases the crypto tokens to your wallet automatically.",

    id: "selling",
    title: "Step 5 — Selling Crypto",
    content: [
      "To sell crypto, click \"Sell USDT\" or \"Sell BNB\" on the P2P Trading page. A form will appear where you set your price per token (in INR), the amount you want to sell, your preferred payment method, and your payment details.",
      "Supported payment methods include UPI, Bank Transfer, Google Pay, PhonePe, Cash/Bank Deposit, Digital Rupee, PayPal, and Wise. Choose the one that works best for you.",
      "You also set a deal timeout (how long buyers have to pay) and an ad duration (how long your ad stays live). Once you submit, your tokens are locked in the escrow contract and your ad goes live.",
      "When a buyer accepts your deal and sends payment, you'll see the deal in your \"My Ads\" page. Verify the payment in your bank/UPI, then click \"Release\" to confirm and send the tokens to the buyer.",

      "The \"Raise Dispute\" button only becomes available after the deal timer expires. This prevents premature disputes and gives both parties enough time to complete the trade.",
      "If a buyer falsely confirms payment without actually sending money: The seller simply doesn't click \"Release.\" After the timer expires, the seller can raise a dispute. The admin reviews the case and returns the tokens to the seller.",
      "If a seller doesn't release tokens after the buyer has paid: The buyer waits for the timer to expire, then raises a dispute. The admin verifies the payment and releases the tokens to the buyer.",
